# MkDocs Zettelkasten
This is a reference guide and a demo of MkDocs Zettelkasten features. If you are new to [Zettelkasten method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), then check [zettelkasten.de - Getting Started](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/).

The purpose of MkDocs is documentation generation. However, Zettelkasten is a method for smartly organizing your notes. I couldn't find any elegant solution to convert my notes from markdown to something pleasant to read and navigate. That is why I built MkDocs Zettelkasten.

The documentation you are reading is created using MkDocs Zettelkasten (yes, I'm eating my own dog food ðŸ˜Š) only to demonstrate its features. If you are writing documentation, don't use MkDocs Zettelkasten. [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) is better for that.

Ok, you are still here, so your goal is to turn your markdown-based Zettelkasten into a static, nicely looking HTML site packed with features every smart notes taker needs. Let's see how I can help.
